\chapter{Improvements of Computational Performance}

% AD was useful when implementing the alternative cost function. Then it was worth the additional computation time. (If slower)
% (If faster with AD): Sufficient optimisation of code can make AD faster than symbolic differentiation given that symbolic was not that optimised.
