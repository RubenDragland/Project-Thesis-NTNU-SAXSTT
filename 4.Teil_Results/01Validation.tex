\section{Symbolic Gradients of Alternative Functional}

%The derived symbolic gradient expression of the alternative functional can be found in Appendix \ref{app:appendixB}.
% The following was the derived symbolic gradients of the alternative functional:

% \begin{align}\label{eq:sym_grad_expsin}
%     \begin{split}
%         \theta &= \frac{\pi}{2} \\
%         Q & = \frac{ \Inhat^{\frac{1}{2}} - \In^{\frac{1}{2}}  }{ \Inhat^{\frac{1}{2}} } \\
%         \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial \theta_{op}} & = \frac{1}{\sin{\Theta}} ( \left(\costhetaop\cosphiop\cos\beta - \sinthetaop\sin\beta\right)\cos\phi \\ &+ \left( \costhetaop\cosphiop\sin\alpha\cos\beta + \costhetaop\sinphiop\cos\alpha + \sinthetaop\cos\beta\sin\alpha \right)\sin\phi ) \\
%         \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial \varphi_{op}} & = \frac{1}{\sin{\Theta}} ( \sinthetaop(-\sinphiop)\cos\beta\cos\phi \\ &+ \left( \sinthetaop (-\sinphiop)\sin\alpha\cos\beta + \sinthetaop\cosphiop\cos\alpha \right)\sin\phi ) \\
%         \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial A} & = 4 \sum_{n, \phi} Q A \exp\left( - B \sin^2 \Theta\right) \\
%         \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial B} & = -2 \sum_{n, \phi} Q A^{2} \sin^{2}\Theta \exp\left( - B \sin^2 \Theta\right) \\
%         \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \theta_{op}} & = - 4 \sum_{n, \phi} Q A^{2} B \sin^{2} \Theta \cos\Theta \exp\left( - B \sin^2 \Theta\right) \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial \theta_{op}}   \\
%         \frac{\partial \epsilon}{\partial \varphi_{op}} & = - 4 \sum_{n, \phi} Q A^{2} B \sin^{2} \Theta \cos\Theta \exp\left( - B \sin^2 \Theta\right) \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial \varphi_{op}} .  \\

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:calc_alt_functional},
the gradient to the cost function \eqref{eq:cost_function_SAXSTT} with the form factor expressed using \eqref{eq:exp_sin_squared} was computed using a symbolically derived expression and by applying an AD engine.
Evaluation of the symbolic gradient expressions for the coefficients $A$ and $B$ agreed with the automatically calculated gradients for all sampled initial values.
The derived expressions for the gradient to the orientation parameters $\theta_{op}$ and $\varphi_{op}$, however, were, and still are, incorrect.
Moreover, relevance of these expressions dimished, because the alternative functional was modified in an effort to improve the performed reconstructions.
Therefore, SAXSTT using the alternative functional had to be implemented using automatically calculated gradients.

\section{Automatic Gradients of SAXSTT}

It was worth comparing the gradients of the first iteration of the SAXSTT algorithm implemented using symbolically and automatically calculated gradients, respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:gradient_comparison} shows
the relative deviation of the automatically calculated gradients with respect to the symbolically calculated gradients for the first iteration of the $a0$-optimisation.
For each voxel, the relative deviation was calculated, and scattered along axes representing gradient magnitude and deviation magnitude, respectively.
Moreover, the colour of each point represents the distance of the voxel from the centre of the volume.
A tendency shown in the scatter plot is that the relative deviation was larger for smaller gradients.
Moreover, the positive deviation indicates that the symbolically calculated gradients were generally larger in terms of magnitude.
The large majority of the automatically calculated gradients deviated less than $5\%$ from the symbolically calculated gradients.
The largest deviation occurred when the gradient magnitude was small, and the voxel was located close to the edge of the sample,
as indicated by the dominant colour in the upper right corner of the figure.

    \caption[Initial Gradient Deviation]{The deviation data is sorted by symbolic gradient value.
        The majority of the voxels had a deviation below $5\%$, while a subsection of the data had a deviation between $15\%$ and $30\%$.
        Naturally, the relative deviation was larger for smaller gradients.
        Also, voxels located close to the edge of the sample had a larger deviation.}
