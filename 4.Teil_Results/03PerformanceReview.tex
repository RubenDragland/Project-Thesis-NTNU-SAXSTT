\section{SAXSTT Time Complexity}

Figure \ref{fig:gradient_time_complexity} shows the time complexity of the gradient computation for the different implementations.
%RSD: Update with SYM as well? Manually. Not the most important thing. 
%RSD: Mentioned Laptop vs Server. Note that GPU and CPU are equally fast. However, if algorithm extended so that the amount of transfer of data is at a relative minimum, a significant speed-up will occur.

    \caption{ The gradient computation time for different number of voxels using a CPU and a GPU, respectively. % Should test CPU on Gamma instead. Mind myself. Not the most important thing. 
        The time complexity is about $O(N)$ for both methods, where N is the number of voxels. However, the GPU provides approximately an 8-fold speedup when the number of voxels is sufficiently high.}

\section{Convergence of SAXSTT}

Figure \ref{fig:Loss_curve_optimal} shows the convergence of SAXSTT after 100 iterations for the different implementations when the initial conditions are close to the optimal solution.
%Update with EXPSIN as well? Evt for carbon knot. Evt include all runs or do normalisation. Difficult to know right now.

    \includesvg[width=0.6\textwidth]{../XRD_CT/Plotting/thesis_plots/Loss_curve_optimal.svg} %RSD: Remember inkscape formatter and scaling. More changes needed to the plot. Generalise number og lines. 
    \caption{ The convergence of the CGD algorithm is steep for each of the optimisation steps.  }

Figure \ref{fig:Loss_curve_worst} shows the convergence of SAXSTT for the different implementations when the initial conditions are far from the optimal solution.

    \caption{ The CGD algorithm is prone to getting stuck in local minima, especially when the initial conditions are not sufficiently good guesses.  }
